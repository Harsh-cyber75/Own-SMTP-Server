SMTP Server Project Using JavaScript and AWS EC2
Introduction
Hello everyone,

I’m excited to share my latest project where I built an SMTP server using JavaScript and an AWS EC2 instance. This was a challenging yet rewarding experience, made possible through research, Google articles, and YouTube tutorials.

This project represents a significant milestone in my learning journey. It deepened my understanding of several core concepts and technologies while helping me overcome real-world development challenges. I’m thrilled with the outcome and the valuable knowledge I’ve gained through this experience.

Key Learnings
Through this project, I acquired in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in the following areas:

Understanding SMTP Servers:

How SMTP servers work and how they facilitate email communication.
The connection process between client-side and server-side SMTP protocols.
JavaScript Development:

Leveraging JavaScript for backend development.
Understanding asynchronous programming and its role in server-side communication.
AWS EC2 and Cloud Computing:

Setting up and configuring an AWS EC2 instance for hosting.
Basics of cloud computing and deploying services on the cloud.
Problem-Solving Skills:
